# DM-assist
A tool to assist dungeon masters in tabletop role-playing games

# Short Description
This tool originated from the idea that it's inconvenient to make several clicks to switch music during a tabletop RPG session.
Gradually, the project gained new features, eventually evolving into a more convenient, modern, and intuitive alternative to
DM helper.

Move the map using LMB with no active tool, or MMB with an active tool. Zoom with the mouse wheel.

The map is automatically saved in dam format on close if it was opened as part of a campaign.
You can also manually save it by right-clicking the tab and choosing **_Save_**.

### Shared Access

### Effect Shapes
![shapes.png](illustrations/shapes.png)

The _shapes_ tool lets you draw spell areas on the map.

Each shape (line, circle, triangle, square) is drawn with two clicks. The first sets the origin point, the second defines size/distance.

Shapes follow [area of effect rules](https://dnd.su/articles/mechanics/157-spellcasting/#areas-of-effect) from D&D.

After the first click, a dynamic preview of the shape appears for convenience:
- Radius for circles
- Length for lines
- Height for triangles
- Edge length for squares

To change color, click <img src="static/palette.svg" width="20"> in the drawing section.

Right-click a shape to delete it.

### Brush

![brush.png](illustrations/brush.png)

The _brush_ tool <img src="static/brush.svg" width="20"> allows freehand drawing on the map.

Brush color is synchronized with the effects tool. You can adjust opacity using a slider.

Use `ctrl + SCROLL` to change brush size (similar to fog tool).

Right-click a drawn line to delete it.

A square or hexagonal grid can be applied to the map. The mode is selected by switching the drop-down list.

## Campaigns
Campaigns allow you to store maps, characters, encounters, and playlists together and load everything at once.

### Creating a New Campaign
Select the menu `Campaign -> New` or press `ctrl + N`.

![create-campaign-dialog.png](illustrations/create-campaign-dialog.png)

In the dialog, enter a name and project folder. The folder must be empty or not exist (the app will create it).

The campaign opens automatically after creation.

### Opening an Existing Campaign
Choose `Campaign -> Open` or press `ctrl + O`.

In the file dialog, select the root campaign folder (containing `campaign.json`).

### Working with a Campaign
Playlists are automatically set when the campaign opens. All music-related work will be saved with the campaign on exit.

A navigation tree appears on the left side.

![campaign-tree.png](illustrations/campaign-tree.png)

Hovering over an element shows interaction buttons.

- Click <img src="static/add.svg" width="20"> on a character to add them to the current encounter or
  <img src="static/edit.svg" width="20"> to open the [editor](#character-editor).

- Click <img src="static/add.svg" width="20"> on an encounter to add it or
  <img src="static/upload.svg" width="20"> to replace the current one.

- Click <img src="static/edit.svg" width="20"> on a map to open it in the main window.

To add files to a campaign, place them in the correct subfolder. Each file type must be in its specific folder.

After adding new files, reload the campaign via `Campaign -> Reload from disk`.

To move a campaign, just move the whole folder to a new location.

### Using tokens
To add a character token to the map, drag its element from the campaign tree onto the open map. If the character image has already been downloaded and is located in the campaign `Tokens` folder, it will be applied. If the image is missing, a stub will be applied.

If the grid is enabled on the map, the token will be magnetically attached to it.

![tokens.png](illustrations/tokens.png)

For tokens, you can change the display mode and font size of the name signature in [settings](#appearance). There are 3 display options in total
- Always display
- Display on hover in a suggestion
- Do not display

By right-clicking on the token, a context menu is opened, from which you can
- Add a character to the encounter
- Open the character editor
- Change the token size
- Remove the token from the card

## Character Editor
Character files use a format compatible with [LSS](https://longstoryshort.app/).

Note: Compatibility is one-way. Characters created here may not work in LSS.

To open a character sheet, click <img src="static/edit.svg" width="20"> in the campaign tree.

![charsheet.png](illustrations/charsheet.png)

All stat bonuses, attack bonuses (except damage), and abilities are calculated automatically based on inputs.

Use the table to edit resources (spell slots, Ki points, etc.).
Click the **_refill_** cell to toggle recovery mode (short/long rest).

Restore resources by pressing the short or long rest button.

Click **Add** next to a table to add a new resource or attack.

Click an attack to edit it.

Use `ctrl + B`, `ctrl + I`, and `ctrl + U` for bold, italic, and underline formatting in note fields.
